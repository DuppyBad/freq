# Frequency Analysis

I couldn't be bothered to always go to decode.fr when it's time for substitution ciphers so this tool is built to quickly check if some ciphertext has suspicious frequencies.

Currently is just invoked via ``freq {file}``

Release is compiled for windows but just clone the repository and run `cargo build`
